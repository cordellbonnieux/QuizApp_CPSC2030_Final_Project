A fullstack quiz application, where users can create accounts and complete quizes using questions pulled in from the open trivia api. The application stores accounts and scores in a database who's information is also accessed by the app, so the user can see how their scores match up with others.

This web application is my final project submission for CPSC2030 at Langara.

Stack: JavaScript ES6, HTML, PHP, CSS, Perl, MariaDB
